"""
If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

Solution comment:
Assume a < b, and know b < c. Then a <= p/2, a < b <= (p-a)/2.

Then simply check if c^2 = a^2 + b^2 is possible and makes the
total perimeter equal to p.
