Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

Solution commment:
I evaluate d(n) by first prime factorizing n, taking all the possible partitions of
the primes and summing the product of them. Hoping this is faster for large n because
prime factorization only needs to look at sqrt(n) numbers. Potential bottleneck is
the partitioning of the primes, a recursive method which is probably not very fast for
large numbers of primes. Find solution for 10 000 in under 2 sec, 100 000 in under 30 sec.
