We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

Solution comment:
Assume a < b < c, just so that we don't include both a x b and b x a.
Then, if a has n digits, there are 9-n remaining. b can at most have
an equal number of digits to c, so b has (9-n)//2 digits.

So for each n, for each 3-length permutation of digits given to a,
b is the (9-n)//2-length permutation of the remaining digits.
Then, if c cointains no repeted numbers, and no digit already
used in a and b, the product is pandigital.
